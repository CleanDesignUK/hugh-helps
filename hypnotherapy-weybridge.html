            Hypnosis helps you tap into the power of your subconscious mind
            to create profound, positive changes in your life. Far removed
            from stage theatrics or mind-control myths, professional hypnosis
            involves a gentle shift into a heightened state of awareness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clients often describe it as feeling deeply relaxed yet fully
            conscious—like the peaceful transition between sleep and waking.
            You maintain complete control over your thoughts and responses,
            allowing you to remain an active partner in the therapeutic process.

            By tailoring each session to your goals, our trained practitioners

              Hypnosis itself is not dangerous. It is a gentle therapeutic technique that promotes a calm, focused state of mind. By combining relaxation with an inward focus, hypnosis can help reduce stress, discomfort, and even issues like anxiety or chronic pain. It also tends to boost confidence, self-control, and emotional well-being. 
              <br><br>
              Recognised as a valid therapeutic modality by the British Medical Association since 1955, hypnotherapy is safe when practised by a qualified, insured professional. I follow these guidelines to ensure you receive a secure, supportive experience.

              Hypnosis does not put you to sleep. You’ll feel relaxed yet very much aware of what is happening. If, for instance, a fire alarm were to sound, you would notice it straight away. Many people liken hypnosis to a vivid daydream or a meditation-like state. You remain in control and can open your eyes or speak at any time.

              Most people can experience hypnosis if they choose to and feel comfortable with it. Everyone’s level of responsiveness varies, but with practice and a willingness to engage, virtually anyone can benefit from hypnotherapy.

              This is a common misconception. Research shows there is no direct link between how ‘strong-willed’ someone is and how receptive they are to hypnosis (Kirsch &amp; Council, 1992; Kirsh, Lynn, &amp; Rhue, 1993; 1996). Hypnosis is not mind-control; it is a collaborative process in which you retain complete autonomy.

              Hypnosis is not a truth serum. You remain aware of what you’re saying and can choose what you share. Hypnotherapy is designed to support you in achieving your therapeutic goals, not to force you to divulge personal information unless you wish to do so.

              No, you cannot get stuck in hypnosis. Think of it as being absorbed in a good book or film. The moment you choose to stop, or if you become distracted, you can simply return to your usual level of awareness.

              While relaxation is indeed an element, there is much more to clinical hypnosis than simple acting or pretending. For instance, people have undergone surgical procedures under hypnosis with minimal or no anaesthetic, which goes far beyond mere relaxation. Social factors and expectations do play a role, but hypnosis is generally accepted as a distinct and valuable therapeutic state.

              It is rare for hidden or disturbing memories to suddenly surface uninvited in hypnotherapy. If traumatic material is explored, it is usually done sensitively, with your consent, and for therapeutic healing. The aim is to help you feel more empowered and at peace, not to cause distress.

              NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) began as a study of how we communicate and interpret our experiences. It involves techniques to shift unhelpful thinking patterns, behaviours, and emotions so we can enhance our overall quality of life. In therapy, NLP can include talking, guided visualisations, and hypnosis-like exercises to encourage positive changes.

            During hypnosis, you are guided into a calm, focused state,
            similar to daydreaming. You remain aware of your surroundings
            and retain full control—you can choose to come out of the
            hypnotic state at any time.

              100% highly recommend Hugh; he is a great guy, very friendly. You can relax and feel comfortable as soon as you meet him. I went to see Hugh in 2010 to give up smoking, as I was a heavy smoker and never thought I’d be able to quit. Thanks to Hugh, he helped to change that for me… I’ve never smoked since. Thank you for helping me out recently too—much appreciated! 😃

I find great value in seeing Hugh on a weekly basis over the last 6 months—for the hypnotherapy, Hugh is able to put me into a deep trance and every session has been impactful. Hugh, you should be charging more, lol.
